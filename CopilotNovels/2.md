# **COPILOT IS CRAZY**

> aka. Shelling is cute

## Story

Shelling is a cute cat programmer, one day she released a new version of the program, and she wants to make it more beautiful.

She has written a program to make the program beautiful, but she is not sure how to do it.

She thinks the original one is inefficienct, so she wants to make it more efficient.

But how?

The old code's time complexity is O(n^2), and she wants to make it O(n).

She scratched her head and thought of two things:

1. How to make the program faster?

2. How to make the program more beautiful?

She is not sure whether to make the program faster or more beautiful, so she asks you to help her to find the best solution.

Here is the puzzle.

## Example

### Example 1

Input:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

Output:

[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1]

Explanation:

The original program is too inefficient, so she wants to make it more efficient.

### Example 2

Input:

[3,2,1]

Output:

[3,2,1]

## Explanation

The original program is too beautiful, so she wants to make it more beautiful.

## Challenge

O(n) time and O(1) extra space, in-place is fine.

## Notice

You can use only constant extra space.

Can you help her to find the best solution?
